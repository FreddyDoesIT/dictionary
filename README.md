## Project Objective

This web app helps non-native speaker to learn English. Sometimes when we read or listen to others, there might be a word / words that we may be not familiar with. So with this app, we can search it. This app differs from traditional online dics. It integrates the searching functionality and the word list. So user can have access to his/her own searching history for review, also there will be review test to make it more interesting.
